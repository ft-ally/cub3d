-Created big struct
-Got NO SO WE EA texture path

to do
Double check the path, it takes everything until '\0' -> what if there's a space and more string?? 
//Protect ft strdup mallocs game assets are initially malloc'd ->free it 
//Save the FC RGB in struct
//Error check the FC RGB
//Check for the spaces and walls
//Check for walkable path (flood fill)
//Save map only to the struct
