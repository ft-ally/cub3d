-Created big struct
-Got NO SO WE EA texture path
+Added validate_path->trims the path (path is only chars before white space, is that correct?) 
					->checks perm/existence of file (open)
+Added getrgb->array that assigns into r g and b.
+Added validate_rgb->checks if rgbstring is numeric and not ","
+Added free functions: free_array, free_all, free_textures

to do
Double check the path, it takes everything until '\0' -> what if there's a space and more string?? 
//Protect ft strdup mallocs game assets are initially malloc'd ->free it 
//Save the FC RGB in struct
//Error check the FC RGB
//Check for the spaces and walls
//Check for walkable path (flood fill)
//Save map only to the struct
