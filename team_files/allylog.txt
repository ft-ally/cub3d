-Created big struct
-Got NO SO WE EA texture path
+Added validate_path->trims the path (path is only chars before white space, is that correct?) 
					->checks perm/existence of file (open)
+Added getrgb->array that assigns into r g and b.
+Added validate_rgb->checks if rgbstring is numeric and not ","
+Added free functions: free_array, free_all, free_textures

-Error protected rgb string (against invalid char, <0 && >255)
-Added random textures for path
-Added check for new lines after rgb
-Added count rows for map
-Added close and open file again
-Added skip to map
-Added copy 2d map to 2d array

to do
!! Elements can be set on any order!! -the skip rgb space will not work anymore. set flags for when they are all done?
//invalid character check on 2d array

//Check for the spaces and walls
//Check for walkable path (flood fill)
//Save map only to the struct


done
//Double check the path, it takes everything until '\0' -> what if there's a space and more string?? 
//Protect ft strdup mallocs game assets are initially malloc'd ->free it 
//Save the FC RGB in struct
//Error check the FC RGB
